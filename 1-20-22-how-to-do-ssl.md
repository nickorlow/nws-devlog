# How to do SSL?

##### Background
NWS has a service that is tenatively called "Container Deployment Service (CDS)" (It was previously called "Cruise"). This service allows people to deploy a docker container to our cluster of kubernetes clusters. In it's current (read: early) form, NWS will add a GitHub Actions pipeline yaml file to the repo which a user wants to deploy. This yaml file will create a dockerfile, and build it into a docker container with 2 tags: an autogenerated semver, and the name of the branch. From here, the NWS APi will store metadata about the application in a database and then add the kubernetes deployment manifests to a gitrepo (this is a newish thing that I learned about called gitops). [Rancher Fleet](https://fleet.rancher.io/) periodically scans this repo, and when it sees the new yamlfile, it manifest files, it deploys it to all kubernetes clusters on the NWS network.
